      Disclaimer, of trading risk Terms of Use, and Risk Disclosure – Algo Trading Software

you must be above 20 years for algo 

Futures and Options (F&O) trading involves substantial financial risk and may not be suitable for all investors. Leverage can work both for and against you. There is a possibility of losing more than your initial capital. The value of options contracts declines over time and can expire worthless. Before engaging in any form of derivatives trading, users should thoroughly understand how margin, volatility, time decay, slippage, and market structure impact profitability and risk.

This software and its related services are offered strictly for educational and executional purposes. We do not provide financial advice, profit guarantees, account management, or any kind of regulated investment service. The platform is intended for traders who are fully aware of market risks and accept full personal responsibility for all outcomes.

We are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and we do not claim to be. Nothing presented in our videos, messages, dashboards, or discussions should be interpreted as investment advice or buy/sell recommendations. All statements, screenshots, or results shown are from personal accounts and are shared only for illustration and educational purposes. Users are strongly encouraged to consult a SEBI-registered investment advisor before acting on any trade or strategy.

The use of this algorithmic software does not imply any partnership, management service, or shared responsibility for trading outcomes. You are solely responsible for your own risk management, capital allocation, and decision-making. Use of this software confirms that you understand the nature of self-directed trading and the possibility of total capital loss.

All payments made to access the algorithmic trading software are strictly non-refundable. This includes but is not limited to software access fees, subscription fees, or any other form of payment related to the use of the platform. Payment is made solely for the access and usage rights of the software, and not for any form of advisory, returns, or managed service. There is no refund available once access is granted, regardless of whether the user profits, loses money, or discontinues use of the platform.

That said, a conditional capital refund may be considered only if certain performance-based criteria are met. A user may request a partial capital refund (not software fee refund) only if they incur a minimum of 50% net capital loss in a single trading day, and only after completing a minimum of 15 trades using the algorithm. All such requests must be submitted with complete, verifiable trading statements from a recognized brokerage. The refund request must be submitted within 15 calendar days of software activation. If these specific conditions are not met — such as losses occurring over a longer time period, fewer than 15 trades, or a gradual drawdown — no refund shall be offered. The refund, if approved, will apply only to lost capital (based on real proof), and not the algorithm fees under any circumstance.

Market conditions may significantly impact strategy performance. Periods of high volatility, illiquidity, or technical issues at the broker or exchange level can disrupt the functioning of the algorithm. Execution delays, slippage, missed orders, or pricing errors may occur. The user must account for these factors when using the software. While the algorithm is designed to respond to market movements programmatically, it is not immune to broader systemic risks, outages, or unexpected behavior due to market instability.

Historical performance, backtests, or past screenshots shown in any material are for illustration only and do not constitute a guarantee of future results. Users must understand that all trading carries risk, including the risk of full capital loss. No strategy or algorithm, no matter how sophisticated, can remove risk from trading. Past performance does not indicate or imply future success.

In some earlier communication or promotional materials, there may have been references to profit-sharing or commission-based reward plans. In full compliance with SEBI regulations, we no longer offer any kind of profit-sharing arrangement. You are paying only for the use of the algorithm, and all profits or losses are entirely yours. Our obligation ends at providing you with access to the software. We do not take a percentage of your returns, nor do we share losses. Profit-sharing discussions are discontinued and shall not be interpreted as part of any agreement.

We reserve the right to revoke access, suspend usage, or refuse service to users who misuse the software, violate the terms, or attempt to reverse-engineer, duplicate, resell, or misrepresent the algorithmic tools. All intellectual property associated with the software, logic, design, and interface belongs solely to [Your Name / Company Name]. Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, sharing of credentials, or repackaging of this system is strictly prohibited and may result in legal action.

No threats, coercive clauses, or exaggerated enforcement actions are part of this agreement. All disputes, if any, regarding non-payment or violations of terms, will be handled strictly through due legal process and within the jurisdiction of the courts governing [Your State or City]. Users are entitled to due notice and legal process. No recovery of fees or enforcement action will be taken without proper authority and court permission.

You are solely responsible for maintaining your own brokerage account, setting up API credentials correctly, and ensuring the software is connected and functioning as intended. We do not take responsibility for incorrect setup, expired API keys, or user errors. It is your duty to test the algorithm on demo or paper trading first if unsure. Do not begin live trading unless you fully understand how the system works.

We do not promote overtrading, revenge trading, or unrealistic expectations. The goal of using algorithmic strategies is to introduce discipline, consistency, and structure — not to chase quick profits. The market does not owe you anything. Trading is not a get-rich-quick scheme. Greed, fear, and FOMO are your biggest enemies in the markets. Emotional trading is dangerous, and relying on tips or copying others will likely lead to losses.

You are advised to follow strict position sizing, risk management, and loss-limiting techniques like stop-loss orders. Never trade money you cannot afford to lose. Do not use rent money, emergency savings, or borrowed capital for trading. Use trailing stops when appropriate. Set daily risk limits. Avoid adding to losing trades without a predefined plan. A single trade will never make you rich, but one bad decision can destroy your account.

Backtesting is useful but not foolproof. Market behavior changes. Fundamental and technical analysis can both fail during high-impact events. Monitor news, but don’t overreact. Avoid trading under emotional stress, distractions, or intoxication. Set trading hours and stick to them. Take breaks. Burnout leads to mistakes.

The performance of one user's account may differ from another, even when using the same algo, due to slippage, capital size, execution speed, or other variables. Please do not compare your results to others blindly. Each trader's experience is unique.

By continuing to use our software, platform, or tools, you fully acknowledge and agree to all of the terms and disclosures presented above. You understand the risks, limitations, refund rules, and legal nature of this agreement. You confirm that you are acting independently and that no financial promise, tip, or return guarantee was given to you before payment.
